# VerLib

This is simple C library for version management in your projects. This library allows to manage the version data in app, like "Version" class in C#.

# Genesis

This library was invented to help me with versioning in [StrayexOS](https://github.com/StraykerPL/StrayexOS)!

# Usage of VerLib

To use VerLib in your project download two files: "verlib.c" and "verlib.h".
In your project's source file add preprocessor instruction `#include "verlib.h"`. After that library is ready to use!

To check, what functions you have, open "verlib.h" to list them.

# TODO
